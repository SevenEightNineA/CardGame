CardGame
========

Practicing Design and language contructs

Goal: Apply and thus internalize concepts from Code Complete 2

Concepts:
Design such as abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritence, coupling, cohesion...
-Central points of control (ie all db connections in one class)

Design:
Card -> LinkedList -> Deck -> Session -> Need something here?!? -> GameLogic (5card draw)
                -> Hand -> Session -> Player
                        -> Player

*Session is central control point*


Todo:


Longterm Additions:
Unit Testing
GUI
